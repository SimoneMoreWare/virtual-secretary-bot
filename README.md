## Description
The **Virtual Secretary Bot** is a Python-based automated application designed to respond to Telegram messages by checking availability in Google Calendar and replying based on scheduled events. It uses the Google Calendar API, `Telethon`, and natural language parsing with `parsedatetime` for a smooth interactive experience.

## Features
- Automatic Responses: Provides real-time updates on availability based on scheduled events.
- Natural Language Processing: Understands and processes queries like "Are you free now?" or "What do you have on [date]?"
- Google Calendar Integration: Retrieves events from the user's primary and secondary calendars.
- Multilingual Support: Translates user inputs to English for better parsing.
- Current Event Check: Notifies users if they are currently busy with an event.

## Why Telethon?

We chose **Telethon** for this project because it stands out as one of the few libraries that support the creation of userbots in Telegram. Unlike other libraries like `python-telegram-bot` or `aiogram`, which are primarily designed for creating bots that interact with Telegram's Bot API, Telethon allows us to interact with Telegram as a regular user. This capability is crucial for our use case, where the bot needs to respond to messages in a personal user context, not just within bot channels or groups. Telethon provides robust functionality for managing user interactions and accessing Telegram's full range of features, making it an ideal choice for implementing a userbot that integrates seamlessly with Google Calendar and other services.

## Installation

To set up this bot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SimoneMoreWare/virtual-secretary-bot.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Obtain API Credentials**:
    * Telegram API: Obtain your api_id and api_hash from Telegram [here](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).
    * Google Calendar API: Follow the [quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python?hl=en) to get your credentials.json.

5. **Configure Your Credentials**:
    * Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual Telegram API credentials and Google Calendar credentials.
    * Ensure you have a credentials.json file for Google Calendar and a token.json file if you've previously authenticated.
    * Set up the bot by creating a `.env` file with the following parameters:
       ```
        TELEGRAM_API_ID=<your_api_id>
       TELEGRAM_API_HASH=<your_api_hash>
       GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=<your_calendar_id>
       ```


## Usage
Show examples of how to use the bot, including screenshots or commands.

   ```
2. Send a message on Telegram, for example:
   - "Are you free now?"
   - "What is the next appointment?"

## Configuration
* Telegram Credentials:
     * Set api_id, api_hash, and phone_number in the script.
